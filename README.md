5 - How To Play
==========================
The objective of the game is to run the farm and make money.  To do this you need to sell
tomatoes, eggs, and milk.  Tomatoes can be grown on your farm in the farm field north of the
house.  

To use the field, player must first hoe the land, plant seeds, and water them daily. After a few 
days the plants will grow.  To get seeds go to the plant store in the village.  To water the plants 
use your watering can.  Before you can water though you will need to fill it up at the pond on your 
farm or the well buy your house or in the town.  After watering your plants for a few days they will 
be ready to harvest.  You will know they are ready to be harvested when you can no longer water them
The sprite will also be different at the last stage. You can use the sickle to cut down any plants 
you no longer want.  The hammer can also be used to untill a tile on the field. 

To get eggs you must go to the Animal store in the town.  Here you can buy chickens.  Once you buy
a chicken it will lay an egg ever day as long as you feed it.  To feed a chicken be sure to buy
fodder.  Fodder is also sold at the animal store in town.  If you forget to feed a chicken, she 
will not have an egg for you to collect.

To get milk you must first buy a cow.  Cows can also be bought from the animal store.  They also
need to be fed daily, just like the chickens.  Cows eat fodder too so be sure to stock up at the
animal store.  Like the chickens, cows will only give you milk if they were fed the day before.

To sell produce you must go to the town.  The plant store will buy your tomatoes and the animal
store will buy your eggs and milk.  Be sure to sell often! 

Every time you use a tool you will lose stamina.  You can see your stamina in the player menu by
hitting i.  Once you run out of stamina you will no longer be able to use tools, so be careful!
You can upgrade your tools to make them use less stamina.  This can be done buy going to the
blacksmith in town.  But he won't help you for free!  To get the tools upgraded you will need to have
enough gold, lumber, and ore.  You can get lumber for the forest.  Just equip your axe and click on
the trees.  After a few hits the tree will fall down and you will automatically get lumber.  To get ore go
to the cave.  Here you can smash rock with your hammer by equipping your hammer and clicking on them.
Bigger rocks take more hits but give you more ore! You can see how much gold, lumber, and ore you have
by checking the player menu with i.
